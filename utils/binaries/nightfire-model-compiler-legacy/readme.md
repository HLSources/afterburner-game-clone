I received these files way back in about about 2007, and luckily still have them on my computer.
studiomdl_new.exe is an updated version of studiomdl.exe that is actually able to compile SMD files that the converter spits out. I think this is just from the HLSDK, and that the original studiomdl.exe here is for the original version of Nightfire?
